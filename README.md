# XS-XML : An extra-small XML parser and compiler.


## <br>Description
**XS-XML is a tiny, basic, single-file, and portable XML parser and compiler.**


XS-XML stands for *'Extra small XML'*. It works fine with simple XML files written as per 
the standards of *version 1.0* and encoding of *UTF-8*.

Though it can parse [CDATA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDATA) and character entity references ([CERs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_XML_and_HTML_character_entity_references)), it does not cater to the following features:
* XML schemas and DTDs
* Name prefixes
* XML namespaces (the xmlns attribute) 


<br>For a quick illustration of the libraryâ€™s functions (their input names and types, and their output types), and their structures, enumerations and variables, refer to the [**xsxml.h**](https://github.com/melwyncarlo/XS-XML/blob/main/src/xsxml.h) file.

<br>To read more about the XS-XML library, refer to its [**Documentation Manual**](https://github.com/melwyncarlo/XS-XML/blob/main/src/Documentation_Manual.pdf).



## <br>Features
* XML file parser and compiler
* Single-file and portable library
* Extracts information in a meaningful manner
* Extracts information in the form of inter-connected nodes
* Perform a basic validation check and returns the result
* Apt for basic, everyday, and non-sophisticated use
* Can search through the extracted data based on given input
* Works with unicode characters (UTF-8)
* Works with CDATA and character entry references (CER)
* Works with both empty (`<tag/>`) and non-empty (`<tag>some data</tag>`) tags
* Works in RAM mode using arrays, pointers and objects
* Works in FILE mode for large XML data files
* The FILE mode relies on the computer file system
* The FILE mode utilises negligible RAM space
* Written in two programming languages: C and JavaScript (JS)

<br>**NOTE:** The FILE mode only works in C, and not in JavaScript (JS), for obvious reasons.

## <br>Motivation

I created this library as a necessity for my other projects. I could not find any viable, single-file, basic XML-parser (one that not just extracts the tag elements, but also connects them in a meaningful way), and so, I decided to create one myself. While using it for my other projects and testing it, I came across a few minor run-time errors (mostly related to segmentation faults due to faulty array memory allocations), which I had immediately corrected.

<br>Hope you find this library useful.
